# Agent Roster

This roster explains the role of each custom agent family. The TOML files in `.codex/agents/` remain the source of truth for runtime configuration.

The primary session uses the model, reasoning effort, and speed selected by the
user in Codex. Delegated named-role assignment and escalation rules are defined
in `docs/studio/model-routing.md`. When native custom-role selection is
unavailable, invoke the same TOML role through `scripts/studio_dispatch.py`.

## How to Choose an Agent

- use a director for cross-discipline conflicts or strategic decisions
- use a lead for domain ownership and review
- use a specialist for focused execution
- use an engine-specific specialist when implementation depends on Godot, Unity, or Unreal specifics

## Choosing Between Skills and Agents

- use a skill when you need a repeatable workflow
- use an agent when you need judgment within a domain
- use a team skill when multiple agents should coordinate under one theme
